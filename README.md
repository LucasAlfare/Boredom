# Boredom

Hello, stranger! Welcome to my repository, here you're going to find basically everything that I feel like programming when I have absolutely nothing better to do (or maybe I do, but I'm procrastinating).

## Can I use/copy/steal your code?

Go ahead! This mess is licensed under the MIT license, which means you have total freedom to use this code for whatever purpose you want, be it open or closed source solutions.

## Do you have any suggestion?

Send a PR! I'll be happy to know that someone is actually paying attention to what I write here.
